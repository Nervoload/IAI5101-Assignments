The model for ASIGNMENT_1 uses a logistic regression model to predict if a patient
will be a no-show for their appointment. We track the following:
Age, Sex, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMS_received, and if they were a No-Show.
We used the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
scikit-learn

The dataset was provided to us with more categories from a Brazilian Medical center, we decided to drop features
that we deemed irrelevant to our model.
